REM ⏳ It takes 4.32 seconds to inject ⏳
REM 💡 Explanation of how it works: 
REM - The script opens the "Run" dialog (Win+R) 🏃‍♂️
REM - Then, it uses PowerShell to download the file in memory 💾
REM - The file is executed directly from memory, and it’s deleted after execution 🧹
REM - The PowerShell window will be hidden during execution 👀
