# Screen-Takeover

## Description
This project creates a spiral effect that takes over the user's screen. It works across multiple monitors if the user has them. The only way to stop it is to reset the computer, or if you're on a laptop, you can try opening a new desktop, but it will also latch onto them. This project is intended for educational purposes onlyâ€”**don't use it maliciously**!

**Warning:** This can be visually overwhelming and might make it hard to use the system. Use with caution!

## Features
- Creates a mesmerizing spiral effect across the screen.
- Works with multiple monitors if detected.
- Easy to run with just a few commands.

## Installation

To use this effect, you'll need Python and the Tkinter library installed. If you don't have Python or Tkinter yet, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python:**
   - Go to [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your OS.

2. **Install Tkinter:**
   Tkinter comes bundled with Python, but if for some reason you don't have it, run the following command to install it:
